Code used for analysis of the experimental videos.

vid_helpers.py contains some helper functions for Analyze_Experimental_Videos.py which is used to extract the curvature from the binary image sequence of experimental data.

Plot_Curvature_STD.py uses the resulting data to plot the curvature profile and the corresponding STD.
